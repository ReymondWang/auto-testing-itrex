Install the required libraries: Python, Selenium, and any other libraries you may need for your specific test case. 2.

Define the test case and its steps: - Open the URL - Find the login button and click on it - Enter the username and password - Click on the submit button - Verify the login is successful - Close the browser 4. Write the test script: ```python # Test script def test_login(): # Open the URL driver.get(\"https://example.com\") # Find the login button and click on it login_button = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, \"button.login-button\") login_button.click() # Enter the username and password username_input = driver.find_element(By.NAME, \"username\") username_input.send_keys(\"test_user\") password_input = driver.find_element(By.NAME, \"password\") password_input.send_keys(\"test_password\") # Click on the submit button submit_button = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, \"button.submit-button\") submit_button.click() # Verify the login is successful WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(visibility_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, \"h1.welcome-header\"))) welcome_header = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, \"h1.welcome-header\") assert \"Welcome, test_user\" in welcome_header.text # Close the browser driver.quit() if __name__ == \"__main__\": test_login() ``` 5.
